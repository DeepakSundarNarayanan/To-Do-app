## Things to do
1. Run the compile the scss so that it can be compiled to css
2. Use this command "npm run sass-dev"
3. Add the css and js in the HTML page.
4. Open Live server to view the final HTML page.

## Basic syntax of JS
Statements:
JavaScript code is divided into statements. Statements are typically terminated with a semicolon (;). For example:

javascript
Copy code
var x = 5; // Variable declaration statement
console.log(x); // Function call statement
Variables:
You can declare variables using the var, let, or const keywords. Variables are used to store data.

javascript
Copy code
var name = "John"; // Declare a variable with the var keyword
let age = 30; // Declare a variable with the let keyword (block-scoped)
const pi = 3.14; // Declare a constant variable
Data Types:
JavaScript supports various data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, and more.

javascript
Copy code
var number = 42; // Number
var text = "Hello, world!"; // String
var isTrue = true; // Boolean
var person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 }; // Object
Functions:
Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be defined and called. Function declarations follow this syntax:

javascript
Copy code
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("Alice");
Comments:
You can add comments to your code for documentation and clarification. JavaScript supports both single-line and multi-line comments.

javascript
Copy code
// This is a single-line comment

/*
This is a
multi-line comment
*/
Conditional Statements:
JavaScript allows you to control the flow of your program using conditional statements like if, else if, and else.

javascript
Copy code
var age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
    console.log("You are not an adult.");
}
Loops:
You can use loops like for and while to repeatedly execute a block of code.

javascript
Copy code
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("Iteration " + i);
}
Operators:
JavaScript supports a wide range of operators, including arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.

javascript
Copy code
var a = 5;
var b = 3;
var sum = a + b; // Addition
var isGreaterThan = a > b; // Comparison
var logicalAnd = true && false; // Logical AND
Objects and Properties:
JavaScript objects are collections of key-value pairs. You can access object properties using dot notation or bracket notation.

javascript
Copy code
var person = { name: "Bob", age: 28 };
console.log(person.name); // Dot notation
console.log(person["age"]); // Bracket notation
Arrays:
Arrays are ordered collections of values. You can access array elements by index.

javascript
Copy code
var colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
console.log(colors[0]); // Access the first element
This is just a basic overview of JavaScript syntax. JavaScript is a versatile language with many more features, so you'll need to explore and practice to become proficient.
